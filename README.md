## Project Overview
Spacecraft flight software and Doom payload development using VizDoom. This project implements an AI agent that autonomously navigates and completes Doom levels using navmesh-based pathfinding, combat behaviors, and genetic algorithm parameter optimization.

DoomSat autonomously plays and completes Doom levels using navmesh pathfinding and genetic algorithm parameter optimization. The agent uses:

# #Installation

1. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Add your Doom WAD** to the `wads/` directory:
```bash
# For shareware Doom
cp /path/to/doom.wad wads/

# Or for full Doom
cp /path/to/doom.wad wads/
```
RENAME the wad file to: doom.wad

## Usage

Run tests with: python3 -m pytest tests/
Run ga report with: python3 ga/report.py output/evolve/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM/

## Potential Future Work
- If node finding becomes a problem, can add blocking segments in _nearest_node()
- Combat blackist (if needed): if we don't kill any enemies after being in combat for a while, it means the enemy is behind some geometry and we need to stop shooting or all ammo will get wasted. Can work similarly to loot node blacklist in path_tracker.
- Move backwards during combat. A few ways to do this. Could make it a GA param. Helpful when there's an enemy with a lot of health and we need more time to kill it.
- A way to allow for more exploration. A detour state or some type of breadcrumb pathfinding could help.
- Hand-crafted genome testing: Add ga/test_genome.json (flat dict of the 7 evolvable params). main.py run checks if it exists. if yes, loads and passes to run_episode(genome=...). If no, runs with hardcoded defaults. Lets you manually set param values and observe behavior in windowed run mode without touching evolved outputs.
- Port to C++ to improve runtime or some other reason (good luck :)
